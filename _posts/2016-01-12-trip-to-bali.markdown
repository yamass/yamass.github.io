I arrived in Bali yesterday. I actually wanted to go to New Zealand but things went a little different than what I had planned.

### Long (!!!) story (with many sub-stories) short:

* From Istandbul I took the flight with China Southern Airlines to Urumqi (China).
* Then (again China Southern Airlines) to Guangzhou 
* Then, me and two other people where asked to come to an office of the airline. That's where things started to get weird.
* They told me I could not enter New Zealand because I had no visa for Australia. Now, if this seems odd to you, to me too, but let me explain: The Kiwis (slang for "New Zealand citizen") want to be sure you leave the country when you enter it, that's normal. When I called the New Zealand Embassy two months ago, they said it was completely sufficient to have a valid flight ticket to another country. In my case, this was a ticket to Australia for January 31st. However, what they did _not_ tell me is the definition of a "valid" flight ticket. It's not only that the ticket has to be payed and so on. You need to have the visa for the destination to. 
* The airlines have to check this with the immigration authorities of the destination country, before the traveler enters the plane. You could now argue: Ok, they did there job correctly, right? Well, I had no visa for China, neither, so they should probably better have told me right in Istanbul.
* My transit visa was only till January 10th. ... and I arrived January 9th, late evening.
* Normally, getting an ETA for Australia takes 5 minutes, if the application is done by the airline. Cost: 20€. However, the guys from China Southern Airlines had no idea on how to proceed with this - really, nobody. I later talked to a guy from the australian immigration authority and he really sorry about that. China Southern Airlines is on their list of airlines which should be able to do this. All other airlines on that list have no office at Guangzhou.
* I stayed in a hotel near the airport with a guy in the same situation. 70€ for a two person room - that was ok. And their, we had internet. (In chinese airports, there is free internet - as long as you have a chinese phone number where they can send the registration code to. In other words: They want to know who you are. Similar in Germany, by the way.) 
* Arrived there, we reviewed our situation: 
  * We had missed our flight.
  * We were not sure if we could get an ETA fast enough to get the next airplane to New Zealand.
  * We could stay only one more day in China.
  * We checked the cost for the next day's flight: over 1000€. So it would depend on the rebooking conditions if that was affordable. 
  * Oh, and by the way: I was not sure where my luggage was. I was told I would get it back the next day.
* OK, so we decided to buy tickets to destinations where we could enter with a visa on arrival (VOA). I bought one for Bali (through Kuala Lumpur), he bought one for Vietnam. (And because I was getting a little bit paranoid, I also bought a ticket from Bali to Malaysia (also a VOA country) for 70€, just to make sure the same thing would not happen to me again.
* The next day, after getting my luggage back (Thank God!!!), I tried to do everything i could to be able to get to New Zealand. I spend hours in the airline office, talked to several australian immigration authority employees (they are acutally not allowed to talk to the travelers directly but only to airline employees... See side stories). They made me enter my application for the ETA myself through the normal web interface, yet, I wasn't able to pay for the ETA application, due to some technical restrictions (see side stories). I finally was taken to the airline's VIP lounge, accompanied by a young (20?) airline employee who spoke english well enough to communicate with him (see side stories) - and he was really interested in helping me!
* Arrived, there, I eventually successfully payed for my ETA application. Now it was time to wait... quite long, as it turned out. Me and some airline employee checked the status of my application regularly.
* I was told I had to wait until the ETA was granted before rebooking my ticket to New Zealand.
* At 20:00, there was still no confirmation, so I finally decided to check in for the flight to Bali.
* 20:20: Baggage checked in right a few minutes before they closed the checkin point.
* 20:30: Passed passport control.
* 20:34: Well, uhm... I got the confirmation from the australian immigration authority for my ETA. Too late. However, now i wanted to know how much it _would have_ cost to rebook my ticket to New Zealand (which was by the way departing 0:30). This was somehow very important to me as I wanted to know if I had done the right thing. So I went back out of the transit zone and went to the airline counter. When I tried to explain the employee my concern, she asked for my passport. However, I had had to leave it at the passport control to be able to get out of the transit zone. So after 5 minutes of explaining, she accepted to just tell me the price for a rebooking I was not going to perform anyway: 19xx€ (I don't remember exactly). And 66€ rebooking charges, that's understood.
* So I was finally happy to know that I was not doing the worst thing by going to Bali :-)

### Side stories:

* You cannot use Google in China. I have read it in the media but you only realize what this means when you get into serious trouble because of it. That said, all confirmation Emails, flight tickets and ETA status emails went straight to my Gmail account, where the 'G' stands for Google - you see. My fellow was luckily prepared for that kind of problem: He showed me how to use an SSH tunnel to a european server and configure it as a proxy. Fortunately, I am an IT nerd, so I both understood what he meant and had access to such a server.
  * That said, it appears that the Gmail mobile app can synchronize some emails. This was the case for my ETA confirmation, for example.
* It was quite difficult for me to find chinese people speaking english well enough to be able to communicate effectively with them. By effectively I mean that you can get to the point where you are sure of what they meant. This unfortunately holds for airline employees...
* Windows XP is not dead at all. It was installed on nearly all computers I saw. Oh and by the way, IE6 is still the browser of choice... (Eat that, @Lamichae, @Stzerhus and @Dalauxte ;-) ) That seems to be the reason why I couldn't pay for my ETA application on there computer.
* There seem to be different ways to register for ETA. At least 2, but I think there is a third one for the airlines. That said, Germans officially cannot apply for an ETA. They have to apply for an eVisa. However, one of the ETA web interfaces still makes it possible to enter Germany ;-)
* The guys from the airline at some point gave me a WiFi password. As I realized later, it seemed to be the airports internal WiFi which spreads all over the airport. 20 Mbit/s down, 8 up. Very very nice!!!

There are still some things I did not mention, but I don't want to make a PHD thesis out of this post.

Instead, I would like to share some first impressions of Bali with you.
