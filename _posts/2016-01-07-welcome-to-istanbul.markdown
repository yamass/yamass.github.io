Hello everybody,

this is the first post of my blog about my kinda-world-trip. I know, the design is - well - currently not too appealing. That's because I had a ton of other things to do.

My trip started yesterday at Trürkismühle where I entered the train to Frankfurt am Main. Then I took the plane to Istanbul where I will stay one day. Wow! One entire day in Istanbul ;-)

I will add photos and stuff as soon I've made interesting ones.

By the way, here's a photo of my luxurious hotel room at [Timeks Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/timeks.en-gb.html):
