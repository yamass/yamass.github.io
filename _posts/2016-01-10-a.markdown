Ok, I have to catch up a little bit on writing. I have had a wonderful day in Istanbul, followed by some very challenging ones. But first, let me tell you about my stay in Istanbul.

Istanbul was awesome!!! And I say that although the day started with some (annoyingly long) phone calls to my bank because one of my credit cards had been blocked after only one withdrawal in turkey. Good to have a backup one...

From [Timeks Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/timeks.en-gb.html) I first went to the blue mosque. The photos (Sorry people, mobile phone camera only!) do not reflect the colorful and bright atmosphere inside. It was amazing.

After this I went over to the red mosque (Hagia Sophia). I payed 10€ just to get inside (while the blue mosque was for free), so I was awaiting something even more delicious to look at. To be honest: I was sooo disappointed by the atmosphere there in. This mosque has much more history (has been a church at first and there are many christian symbols inside), yes, But it is not half as beautiful as the blue one. Therefore, I did not take many photos...

After that, I originally wanted to enter the underground cisterns of the city, but I decided not to do that and head over to the grand bazar with its approximately 3000 small shops. You hardly can manage to not get lost in here. My hotel manager (I hope that's correct) who had explained me all the stuff I should visit, told me that I should simply walk until I get out anywhere and then just go downwards to orientate to the Galata Bridge.

I got something to eat at a small Döner restaurant on the other side of the bridge before entering the more modern parts of the city.

I discovered a small baglama shop and went inside to ask if I could try playing one of those. The shop owner (I believe) was very friendly and invited me to sit down. Then he chose one of his maybe 50 baglamas and gave it to me. Turns out to be tuned in a quite weird way. And frets allow to play more notes than those on classic guitars. In fact, its a real superset of the european 12-tone system. There are not only half tones, but quarter tones. Once you get the idea, the frets are quite straight forward to handle :-)

I also discovered a very nice small church along the Istiklal Caddesi. No photos allowed inside... I realized it only after having taken some ;-)

The city filled up in the late evening. At 10:00pm there was a huge crowd in the pedestal zone, comparable to amount of people in german cities at the last saturday before Chrismas. However in Istanbul, I saw young and old people, families, couples in love, groups of friends or students - people of any kind effectively. And it was very easy to get in touch with anybody, which I greatly appreciated. I am surprising myself at how easy I make friends, or at least have a good time with people :-)

During the flight, we had been served a piece of turkish delight - I loved it and consumed quite a bit of it :-))

So long so far. At the time of writing this, I am in a plane going to Kuala Lumpur. Surprised? Me too ;-) I will tell you more in the next post...
