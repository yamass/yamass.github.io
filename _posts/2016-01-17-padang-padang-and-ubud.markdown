I spent the first fiew days in Bali surfing at Padang Padang beach and am now in Ubud, a town in the center of Bali. It is one of Bali's arts and culture centers.

I didn't make many photos of my time at Padang Padang. I turn out to be a rather lazy photographer. In fact, I try to avoid all thoughts on "what the others would like to see" and - more important - "what I would like the others to see". We tend to judge our lives by the way others would judge it. And that's a big mistake, IMHO.

Surfing was cool :-) The first two days I took lessons. After 90 minutes I was completely exhausted. It was the third day when I realized why it had been so tiring to me. When you have got a teacher, your time is limitted and you want to get the maximum out of your lesson. So you paddle to the lineup and when a wave comes, your teacher helps you to get on the wave by pushing you. Then you directly  paddle back, no matter what. No break, no rest, maximum effort. 

The third day, I only rented the (total beginners) board and tried it on my own. I turned out to be much less physically challenging as I could go at my own natural rhythm (ok, and I had learned some important things, too). I doubled the 90 minutes of the days before. Unfortunately, my skin made clear that it had a substantial say in the matter... I got quite burned and spent the last day in Padang Padang in my small room (reading Linus Torvalds' biography and listening to an audio book on non-violent communication by Marshal Rosenberg) and restaurants.

On the last evening, I went into a restaurant with cool live music. It turned out to be just a bass and a guitar player. And - more important - you were allowed to participate :-) That was very very cool! I played the guitar and (while other guitar players were playing) percussion and we had _a lot_ of fun.

I also rented a scooter which I wanted to use for my whole stay here in Bali. However, quality standards here are not what they are in Germany. First, I had to change the scooter due to a completely worn rear brake (The front brake was working perfectly, but I learned quite fast that using only the front brake could get quite interesting / dangerous!!). Then, the evening before my departure to Ubud, the second scooter did not start anymore. I was luckily only 200m away from the lessor, so I could return it without any problem. In view of all that dependability, I now preferred to take a taxi to Ubud instead of driving there by scooter. 

If you happen to have a stay in Southeast Asia, check out the app "GrabTaxi". 150,000 rp for a trip from Padang Padang to Ubud. That's 10â‚¬ for a 50km (1h45m) travel. And it's _much_ safer than going by scooter. And your skin will be thankful, too.

Arrived in Ubud, I finally  got a high quality scooter. It's a Honda and it feels like driving a Mercedes - quiet ant powerful. I _love_ it. 

Yesterday, I witnessed a traditional cock fight - or at least the first 5 seconds. Then, I decided to leave. I literally could not stand what I was seeing. I don't want to go into any details but it's horrible what these creatures went through.

I spent near to 3 hours in the first music store I found selling (playable) guitars. It was quite fun :-) People here are much more open (or should I say less shy and self-critical) when it comes to making music.

I also witnessed a traditional ceremony. Each half year there is a festivity to say thank you to the trees which give us fruit. Impressive and fun :-)
