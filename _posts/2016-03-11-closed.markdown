After nearly two months without posts, I hereby officially announce that this blog is dead. The reason is simple: I've got better things to do than writing a blog.

However, I have recently started posting irregularly on Facebook :-)

To be fair, here's a quick list of things that I've done since my last post:

* Balinese cooking class
* Bycicle tour in the center of Bali (near Ubud)
* Got a certified diver (SSI)
* Windsurfing
* Trying all types of fruit
* Going to Sanur and Kuta (both not so nice places...)
* Travelling to Australia
* Hiking near Lorne (1 week)
* Road trip through Tasmania (with a friend of mine)
* Travelling to New Zealand (yes, they let me in)
* Done a ton of different things there. Highlights:
  * Went to Cape Maria
  * Diving at Beach of Islands
  * Went to Tane Mahuta
  * Went to Hot Water Beaches
  * Black water rafting (Waitamo)
  * Went to Tamaki Maori Village
  * Sky diving at Taupo 
  * Wild water rafting (River Valley)
  * Fairy to South Island
  * Done the Abel Tasman Coastal Track (5-day-hike with tent)
  * Chilling and playing beach volleyball
 
... and quite a few more things I forgot to mention... I am having a good time :-)

So see you on Facebook (but even there I'm not going to share my whole life ;-) )
